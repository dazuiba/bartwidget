 - Click the speaker button for voice announcements on the 
   currently-displayed route.

 - The trip area automatically scales horizontally, so long trips
   don't run off the end of the widget.
   
 - The time/date bar stays in sync when you drag or scroll the
   trip area.
   
 - Map baubles shrink when you drag them, so it's easier to see
   the map.

 - Fares and holiday schedules are updated.  Profuse thanks to
   Michael Andersen, Annie Madej, and Jeff Baker for updating
   the fare tables for me.
